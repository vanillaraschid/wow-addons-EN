Expanded Description:
Updated for the 1.11.1 Patch

Updated for the 1.10 patch.

I noticed that this Addon had not been updated in some time. Taking the original 2 authors design and code, I expanded it
somewhat to:

1. Update the Addon for the 1.8.1 patch.
2. Added new colors (Gray and Black). 

NOTE: 90% of the code in this version should be credited to the original authors of the Addon.

Future Development:

I really don't want to add a lot to this Addon. It runs well and there are many Addons these day for the AH. 
I am planning to do the following, but have no release date yet:

1. Remove the "Already Known" Items from the list entirely, thus leaving only the items you can use.
2. I'll look into what it will take to make this work with ALTs.
3. Add a Color Picker, so that you are not limited to a few colors.

Usage:
/fk - Help
/fk <color> - Changes the "Already Known" Items to be colored.
              Available Colors: green, blue, red, gray, black
