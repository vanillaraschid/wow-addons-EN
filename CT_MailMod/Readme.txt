CT_MailMod v1.3 (1500)r
-----------------------------
CT_MailMod adds a \"Mass Mail\" option to your mail window.  This option allows you to send up to 21 items or stacks of items to the same person with one click.  Simply enter their name and add the items, the subject will automatically show each items name, in addition to any subject you enter.

For example: Here''s your cloth [Runecloth x20]

The body text will show items #x of #y for however many you send. (#1 of 14)

The total amount for sending all mails will be calculated into the upper right of the window, and a confirmation box will ensure you know.  Each mail will have a 2-4 second delay between sends, based on your latency.

CT_MailMod also adds the ability to Alt+Click to add items to both regular mail and Mass Mail.  In addition, if sending a regular mail, and the subject field is left blank, the items name will automatically be put into the subject.

One final addition that CT_MailMod adds is the ability to auto-fill guildmates names.  Previously, only people on your friends list would be auto filled.
